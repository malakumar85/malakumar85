I was previously a Senior Advisor at the World Health Organization, where I supported the Open Source Programme Office that I helped launch while I was the Director of [Tech for Social Good](https://web.archive.org/web/20230330200002/https://socialimpact.github.com/tech-for-social-good/) on the GitHub Social Impact team. Previous to joining GitHub in April 2019, I worked in tech for international development (ICT4D) as a UX researcher and designer, mostly for the United Nations.

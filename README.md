### About Mala

I am currently a Senior Advisor at the World Health Organization, where I support the Open Source Programme Office that I helped launch while I was the Director of [Tech for Social Good](https://socialimpact.github.com/tech-for-social-good/) on the GitHub Social Impact team. Previous to joining GitHub in April 2019, I worked in tech for international development (ICT4D) as a UX researcher and designer, mostly for the United Nations.

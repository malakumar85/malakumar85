### Hello World!

I am the Director of [Tech for Social Good](https://socialimpact.github.com/tech-for-social-good/) on the GitHub Social Impact team. Previous to joining GitHub in April 2019, I worked in tech for international development (ICT4D) as a UX researcher and designer, mostly for the United Nations. 

If you're curious about my work, you can read more <a href="https://malakumar.com" target="_blank">on my website.</a> At any given time, it's like 78% updated. I made that number up.

### About Mala

For the rest of 2023, I am:

- **Searching for my next permanent, full-time job in the private sector**
- Doing some light advising work for the ITU and other organizations [listed here](https://malakumar.com/tech-social-good-strategy-design/#AdvisoryWork)
- Finishing a few key milestones ahead of my second novel - *[What it Meant to Survive](https://malakumar.com/writing/what-it-meant-to-survive/)* - publication in October 2024
- Taking a break!

I was previously a Senior Advisor at the World Health Organization, where I supported the Open Source Programme Office that I helped launch while I was the Director of [Tech for Social Good](https://web.archive.org/web/20230330200002/https://socialimpact.github.com/tech-for-social-good/) on the GitHub Social Impact team. Previous to joining GitHub in April 2019, I worked in tech for international development (ICT4D) as a UX researcher and designer, mostly for the United Nations.
